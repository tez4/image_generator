  - background (.exr files by [polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris))
  - custom_planes (self-made .blend files containing surfaces for product pictures)
  - interior_models (.blend files by [interior models](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/1000-interior-models))
  - materials (folders with .blend files and textures by [polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/textures))
- functions (python code)
- output (outputs can be found here. Is not version controlled)
